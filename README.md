# Prognostic-AI Multi-Disease Prediction 

The project involves using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of three different diseases - Diabetes, Heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. The project likely involved collecting data on various patient attributes and medical history and using this data to train the machine learning models. The goal of the project is to develop accurate prediction models that can be used to identify individuals who may be at risk for these diseases, potentially allowing for early intervention and treatment.
